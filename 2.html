 <br><br>We are dreaming of a new Art economy-VANEeconomy-

<p style="margin-top:45px;">Now blockchain can provide the foundation for a secure and efficient market that enables buyers and sellers to transact directly without intermediaries. An open, agile platform can energise art markets and bring millions of investors off the side-lines.</P>
<img src="lion.jpg"width="100">
The lack of innovation within art finance stems from the dominance of old auction houses. The largest —Sotheby’s and Christie’s —monopolise 80% of the secondary market volume. They present an identical fee structure, which can see art buyers paying up to 25 percent commission — and sellers are charged even more.ii Auction houses also control access to information as there is no single art marketplace that provides a proper price discovery mechanism.
In other words, it’s nearly impossible to know the fair price of an artwork because there are no
reliable means for investors to assess market sentiment. In other asset classes, like public company stocks or even cryptocurrencies, any investor can tap into historical and real-time exchange price feeds to build pricing models.
The fine art industry doesn’t have any of that. There are no order books or exchanges, and historical information is both scarce and sparse since art pieces are traded so infrequently.
We will completely remove intermediaries who profit from controlling and manipulating
information. We will replace brokers with smart contracts that transparently define auction rules,
bidding systems and income distribution.
Masterpieces will be traded briskly through an open exchange, giving frequent updates of what the artworks are really worth. Portfolio managers will be able to price their positions more accurately and diversify their risk by investing in a range of different art assets.
